# PWine
## _Assault Cube Trainer_

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

PWine is an Assault Cube Hack, made 4 years ago, using the coding language c++, I found this old project in my external hard drive, I'm planning to improve and maybe recode it...  If you want to help me, do NOT hesitate in making a pull request.

- C++ pure
- Simple & Easy to build
- Uses ReadMem and WriteMem
- Uses pointers so when you restart the game the variable is not lost

## Features (___going to add more soon___)

- Infinite health
- Infinite ammo
- Quit with no memory leaks
